/**
 * The bridge: a short passage of the OUTGOING track's low end carried forward under the
 * INCOMING track's own head, on the incoming's own bar grid.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is for.</b> A blend of two records is a fade in the middle whatever the gain
 * curve does, because the outgoing track's <em>rhythm</em> leaves with it: the low end is handed
 * over part way through the overlap ({@code PlayerController.BASS_SWAP_AT}), and from that
 * instant its kick is gone while its body fades over the next seconds. Nothing on the outgoing
 * side can fix that — it is one stream, and its low end has already been taken away by the one
 * knob there is. So the fix belongs on the other side of the seam: the outgoing track's bass,
 * cut out of its own deck, carried forward <em>inside the incoming track's file</em>, and played
 * by the deck that is still there. The passage where it is carried is what this class computes,
 * and it is the one place the two songs' material is genuinely combined rather than merely
 * overlapped.
 *
 * <p>That placement is forced by one hazard: <b>the incoming deck's file is heard at the same
 * time as the outgoing deck's own tail</b>, so anything carried forward that the outgoing deck is
 * still playing sums with itself — a coherent doubling, or a comb filter if the two copies
 * landed within a fraction of a millisecond of each other (they never do sample-exactly: the
 * incoming player's start latency is 123-822 ms, so the truthful worst case is a rhythmic flam,
 * which is worse). The bridge therefore starts at the instant the outgoing deck <em>gives its
 * low end up</em> — when a bridge exists the mix's low-end hand-over is moved to the bridge's
 * own start — and it carries exactly the band that hand-over takes away. Nothing is duplicated
 * because the outgoing deck has already stopped playing it.
 *
 * <p><b>What is deliberately not carried, with the arithmetic that excluded it.</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The outgoing's drums.</b> The platform's per-player equalizer is a five-band graphic
 *       EQ and the hand-over can only take the band below 200 Hz, so a carried drum stem would
 *       double its snare and hats against the outgoing deck at whatever gain its fade curve still
 *       has there — measured, -2.7 dB of the outgoing's own level at 72% of the blend and
 *       -8.7 dB at 90%, i.e. an audible coherent copy. Excluded.</li>
 *   <li><b>The outgoing's melodic content ({@code other}).</b> The same arithmetic, and it
 *       cannot be gated: the low band is the only band the hand-over frees.</li>
 *   <li><b>The outgoing's vocals.</b> Never, in any passage: the DJ edit's removal window exists
 *       so that the two songs do not sing over each other.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic on separated stems — no platform, no files — so what a render will do is a
 * unit test and the acceptance numbers ({@link #measure}) are the same arithmetic the render
 * reports.

     * last whole bars, stretched so that it is <em>heard</em> at the outgoing track's own tempo,
     * and clipped to the bridge's window.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the outgoing's last bars.</b> The carried passage has to be the groove the
     * listener is hearing the outgoing track leave on, so it is taken from the end of that track
     * — its own last whole bars, anchored on a line of its own bar grid (found with the same
     * downbeat estimate the vocal return uses, from the separated bass).
     *
     * <p><b>Why it is stretched.</b> The incoming deck plays this file at {@code speed}
     * ({@code periodB/periodA} — the tempo lock of {@link MixNaturaliser}), so everything inside
     * it is heard that much faster. Carrying the outgoing's bass at unity would carry it at the
     * wrong tempo and the "continuation" would be a flam. Stretching it by {@code speed} inside
     * the file makes it heard at the outgoing track's own tempo <em>and its own pitch</em>: the
     * plain resample drops the pitch by {@code speed} (which is what {@link
     * Report#pitchOffsetSemitones} records about the material <em>as written</em>) and the deck's
     * own playback rate puts it back, exactly, because the two ratios are the same number.
     *
     * <p>⚠️ <b>The stretch lengthens; it does not shorten</b> ({@link #stretch}'s ratio is the
     * factor the signal is lengthened by, and the two must agree or the carry is heard at
     * {@code speed²}). Reading the material <em>faster</em> on the way in — which this method did
     * until round 18, against its own javadoc — would be the flam this stretch exists to remove,
     * doubled: at the ±8% the tempo lock allows, a carried bar would land up to 16.6% early and
     * up to 1.3 semitones sharp. No device has ever played a bridge (see AI_HANDOFF §零: the one
     * bridge that was ever rendered was never played), so nothing about the legacy path is
     * preserved by keeping the old sense — the change is named here rather than made silently.
     *
