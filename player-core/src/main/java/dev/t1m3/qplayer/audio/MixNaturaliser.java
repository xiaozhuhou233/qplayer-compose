/**
 * What has to be done to the incoming track for the two to sound like a mix rather
 * than like two songs at once: how much its tempo is pulled onto the outgoing
 * track's grid, and how many semitones it is transposed into the outgoing track's
 * harmony.
 *
 * <p><b>This is a naturaliser, not a gate.</b> {@link BeatProfile} alignment can
 * only say <em>when</em> to put two beats together; it cannot help a pair whose
 * beats never meet, and it says nothing about harmony. Pulling the incoming track's
 * tempo by a few percent makes the two grids literally the same grid — which is
 * what lets a fifteen-second overlap be aligned at all, since the compatibility
 * gate tolerates about 1.6% of tempo difference over 15 s and this library's pairs
 * slide 2% and more — and transposing it by a semitone or two puts it in the
 * outgoing track's key. Both are small, pitch-preserving corrections applied to the
 * <em>incoming player only</em> (see {@link IncomingMix}), and both are undone over
 * a few seconds: the tempo once that track is the audible one (the last moment it can
 * be — see {@link IncomingMix}), and the transposition earlier, before that track's
 * vocals arrive, because a transposed vocal must never be heard
 * ({@link #pitchFitsBeforeVocals}).
 *
 * <p>⚠️ What this class can <em>not</em> do is take a blend away. An earlier round
 * had the same arithmetic answering "suitable / not suitable" and let a refused pair
 * fall back to a shorter, un-stretched ramp; that turned a taste measurement into a
 * precondition, which is the thing this round reverses. Every answer below is a
 * ratio and a semitone count, both of which may be "nothing" — the pair is
 * overlapped either way, and the only consequence of a bad measurement is that the
 * correction is not applied. The reasons are still measured and still named, because
 * "nothing was stretched" has to be readable from the log as a decision rather than
 * as an omission (see {@link #note()}).
 *
 * <p>Immutable, and cheap (twelve-bin arithmetic over two cached profiles): built
 * once per boundary, inside the same decision that picks the transition kind.
