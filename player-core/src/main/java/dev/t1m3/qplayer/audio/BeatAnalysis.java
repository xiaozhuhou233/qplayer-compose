/**
 * The tempo/beat-grid estimator, as plain arithmetic on mono samples: no platform
 * types, no dependencies, nothing that needs a device. Splitting it out of the
 * Android {@link BeatProfiler} implementation is deliberate — the decoding is
 * platform code, but the part that can be <em>wrong</em> is this, and keeping it
 * plain Java means it can be run on a desktop JVM against signals whose answer is
 * known (a click track at 160 BPM must come back as 160 BPM) instead of being
 * judged by whether its output looks plausible on a phone.
 *
 * <p>The method, in the order the code runs it:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Onset strength envelope.</b> Short frames (40 ms every 10 ms) of mean
 *       square energy, log-compressed, first-differenced and half-wave rectified —
 *       a cheap stand-in for spectral flux that needs no FFT and reacts to exactly
 *       what a beat is: a sudden rise in energy. A local mean is then subtracted
 *       (per ~150 ms) so a quiet passage in a loud track still registers its
 *       attacks, and the result is mean-removed for the correlation below.</li>
 *   <li><b>Period by autocorrelation, at fractional lags.</b> The envelope is
 *       sampled every hop, but a period is not on that grid (a 160 BPM beat is
 *       37.6 hops) — correlating only at whole hops both misses the true peak and
 *       hands the win to its double, which is always closer to a whole number. So
 *       the correlation interpolates the envelope and is evaluated on a fine lag
 *       grid, each candidate scored as the mean of its correlation and those at
 *       two and three times the lag (the "harmonic sum": a click track correlates
 *       just as well at twice its beat period, and the sum is what lets the true,
 *       shorter period win over a half-tempo one).</li>
 *   <li><b>Period selection by the beat-rate heuristic.</b> For perfectly periodic
 *       material the beat and its double are mathematically indistinguishable (the
 *       signal really is periodic at both), so no amount of correlation can choose
 *       between them — a listener chooses, by tapping at the fastest level that
 *       still feels like the pulse. That is the rule here: the <em>shortest</em> lag
 *       that is a local correlation peak and explains the signal within
 *       {@link #BEAT_RATE_TOLERANCE} of the best one wins. It is why a 175 BPM
 *       track is reported at 175 and not at its half.</li>
 *   <li><b>Phase by pulse-train correlation.</b> The offset of a pulse train at the
 *       chosen period that collects the most onset energy, i.e. where the beats
 *       actually are in the file. The train uses the fractional period, so it keeps
 *       tracking the beats across the whole window instead of drifting away from
 *       them by half a hop per beat. It is the strongest phase, not necessarily the
 *       bar's downbeat: bars are structure, and nothing here measures structure.</li>
 *   <li><b>Confidence</b> from two things a beat has and a sustained pad does not:
 *       the pulse train is actually where the energy is (the onset energy collected
 *       on the beats versus the window's average), and — the reading the gate uses —
 *       that the window <em>agrees with itself</em>: split into equal segments, does
 *       every one of them answer the same period and the same phase? A steady grid
 *       answers the same from any part of the track, whatever its envelope looks
 *       like; the peak's prominence over the lags around it (the original reading,
 *       still measured and reported) does not, because on densely produced music
 *       every lag is busy and a perfectly steady grid's peak stands above very
 *       little. See {@link #windowAgreement}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is adaptive beyond that, and no attempt is made to follow a
 * tempo change, a ritardando or a bar structure. A constant period is the whole
 * model; the caller bounds what a wrong one can do.

     * How much the analysis window agrees with itself — the reading the confidence
     * gate is made of.
     *
     * <p>Peak prominence (the reading this replaced) measures how far a track's
     * autocorrelation peak stands above the lags around it. On real, densely produced
     * music every lag is busy — hats, snares, synth stabs are onsets at every
     * subdivision — so a perfectly steady grid's peak stands above very little. On a
     * real library that refused roughly half of it (0.12-0.34, for tracks whose grids
     * are audibly steady) while accepting the same kinds of tracks it rejected.
     *
     * <p>What matters instead is that the measurement holds across the window: the
     * span is cut into equal segments, each is asked for its own period and its own
     * phase with the same rules, and the confidence is how well they answer the same
     * thing. A track with a steady grid answers the same from any part of it,
     * whatever its envelope looks like; a free-tempo passage, a stretch of speech or
     * a segment that hears a different multiple does not.
     *
     * <p>Two parts, multiplied:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>tempo</b> — the worst segment's correlation at the window's own period,
     *       against the best that segment has to offer
     *       ({@link #MIN_SEGMENT_SUPPORT}). One segment that does not confirm the
     *       grid is enough to refuse: the period is what the alignment extrapolates
     *       across the track, so a third of the window that does not hold it means the
     *       grid is not a property of the track.</li>
     *   <li><b>phase</b> — how far each segment's own beats sit from where the
     *       window's grid puts them, as a fraction of a beat, over
     *       {@link #PHASE_SPREAD_TOLERANCE}, averaged over the segments: one phase
     *       has to be picked for the whole track (the window's own), and this says
     *       how much of the window supports it. The worst segment does not decide
     *       here — see the tolerance for why an accent-level disagreement is
     *       ambiguity rather than a wrong grid.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A segment that answers nothing at all (no period, or too few beats for a
     * phase) is skipped rather than counted as a disagreement: silence or a spoken
     * intro is not evidence that the track has no beat. Fewer than two segments that
     * answered means there is no agreement to measure, and the caller keeps the
     * prominence reading.
     *
     * @return 0..1, or -1 when the window is too short or too uninformative to be
     *         split into at least two answering segments
