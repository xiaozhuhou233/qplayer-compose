/**
 * The cloud call the ambience bed is made of: the two neighbours assembled into one buffer, the
 * repaint request that asks the music model to fill the silence between them, and the arithmetic
 * that turns the answer back into the material {@link StemBed} places under the passage.
 *
 * <p><b>What the cloud is asked, and why it is asked this way.</b> ACE-Step's {@code repaint} task
 * regenerates one window of a source file and returns the rest of that file's waveform untouched
 * (the server splices the original samples back after VAE decode, with a 25 ms crossfade at each
 * boundary). So the way to get a passage made of <i>both</i> neighbours is to hand the model one
 * buffer that already contains both of them:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     source  = [ A's tail ][ digital silence, gapMs long ][ B's head ]
 *     repaint = [ tailMs, tailMs + gapMs )   — the silence, and nothing else
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The window's source latents are replaced by silence (the server's own
 * {@code conditioning_masks}), so what the model is really asked to do is fill a hole that is
 * conditioned on A on its left and B on its right. Two consequences are load-bearing here and both
 * are facts about the server, not about this code:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code repainting_start} and {@code repainting_end} <b>must be sent</b>. Their defaults
 *       ({@code 0.0} and none) regenerate the whole file, which throws both neighbours away.</li>
 *   <li>The window is not something the model can be made to match a level with: the server
 *       peak-normalises the <b>whole returned file</b> to −1 dBFS, so our own preserved samples come
 *       back scaled by a gain that depends on the generated material's peak. {@link #gain} measures
 *       that gain off a region whose bytes we know, and {@link #invert} divides it out. It is
 *       measured, never assumed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Where the two contexts come from, and this is the part round 32 corrected.</b> The passage
 * this bed goes under occupies {@code [entryMs, fusionEndMs)} of the <b>incoming</b> track's own
 * file, so the model's right context has to start at {@code fusionEndMs} — the position the passage
 * hands back to B — and not at B's offset 0. The window's length is therefore exactly
 * {@code windowMs}, and {@link #geometry} refuses rather than approximate: {@code gapMs} must equal
 * the passage window, because a bed made for a different window cannot be summed under this one.
 *
 * <p><b>What the answer is worth.</b> Measured on real runs: the model's material opens 23–56 dB
 * below the outgoing track, its crest factor is about 20 dB against the songs' 10–12, and on the
 * window lengths this app needs it is often too sparse or too flat to be texture at all — that is
 * {@link StemBed}'s acceptance clause's business, and a refusal there is this feature's normal
 * failure. What is <i>this</i> class's business is that all of that is measured and reported rather
 * than assumed: one bad number from the cloud costs one log line, never a wrong sample in a file.
 *
 * <p><b>No platform and no network here.</b> Everything in this file is arithmetic on samples and
 * bytes, so "is this request the one the design says, and does this answer invert correctly" is a
 * unit test. The one thing that is not here is the POST itself ({@link
 * dev.t1m3.qplayer.ai.AceStepClient}, which is {@code HttpURLConnection} and a Bearer header).
