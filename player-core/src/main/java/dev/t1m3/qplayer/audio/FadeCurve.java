     * The staged, DJ-shaped hand-over: the outgoing track is <em>taken down to a low bed
     * early</em> and then <em>leaves</em> it part way through, and the incoming track
     * arrives as a bed under it and grows to its own level by the end of the window.
     * This is the shape that makes a long overlap read as a mix rather than as a fade —
     * and, since round 17, the one that keeps the outgoing track's (unremovable) vocals
     * from being the loudest thing in the blend.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the symmetric curves read as a fade.</b> With {@code cos}/{@code sin}
     * the two levels are only comparable while {@code t} is near the middle: the
     * gains cross at half a period and the stretch where the listener can hear
     * <em>two</em> tracks is about 41% of the window (measured by
     * {@link #bothAudibleMs(long, float)}), split evenly on both sides of the
     * middle. A fifteen-second ramp therefore spends the first third fading one
     * track up and the last third fading the other one out, which the ear reads as
     * "the song changed" — the complaint this curve answers.
     *
     * <p><b>What round 17 changed, and why.</b> Rounds 12–16 held the outgoing track
     * within 3 dB of its own level until three quarters of the window. That maximised
     * the both-audible share (68%) — and it was the wrong target, because the reason
     * the listener hears "two songs fighting" is not that both are audible, it is that
     * both are <em>loud</em>, and the outgoing track's vocals cannot be taken out of it
     * (see {@link #OUT_BED_DB}). The shape is now written in <b>decibels</b>, in three
     * eased stretches: down into a −10 dB bed over the first three tenths, held there
     * until the middle, and gone (six decibels under {@link #INAUDIBLE_DB}) by 82%.
     *
     * <p>Measured over a 15 s ramp ({@code FadeCurveTest} prints the same table; the
     * "before" column is what rounds 12–16 shipped):
     *
     * <pre>
     *                     t=0.25   t=0.50   t=0.75   t=0.90   -30dB at   -60dB at   both6dB
     * before (cos t^2.6)   -0.0dB   -0.3dB   -2.7dB  -17.9dB   14.10s     14.72s       68%
     * after  (this shape)  -9.3dB  -10.0dB  -59.6dB  -66.0dB    9.46s     11.28s       17%
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>So the outgoing track's vocals are 10 dB down within the first quarter of the
     * blend, 30 dB down by the start of its last third and gone 3.7 s before the blend
     * ends — against "at its own level until three quarters, then gone in a second". The
     * both-audible share falls from 68% to 17%, and that is the point rather than a
     * regression: the earlier number described two tracks at their own level at once.
     *
     * <p>The incoming track is the sine of {@code t^0.45} (see {@link #IN_BED_EXPONENT}):
     * it reaches half its level within the first tenth of the window, is a real bed from
     * there on, and owns the last stretch alone. The two are summed, so the blend's own
     * loudness dips about 1.9 dB at a fifth of the ramp (the outgoing track leaving faster
     * than the incoming one arrives) and is back at one track's level by two thirds of it;
     * the peak every earlier version had — up to +2.3 dB in the middle — is gone (+0.2 dB,

     * window, the incoming deck rises <em>exactly</em> 0 → unity over the same window, and both
     * are then <b>constant</b> for the rest of the ramp.
     *
     * <p><b>Why this shape exists, and why the other three cannot stand in for it.</b> Every
     * earlier shape is a pair of levels travelling in opposite directions over the whole window,
     * which is a crossfade — and the requirement the fusion answers is that the audible gesture
     * must never read as one. The fusion's file has the outgoing track's own material inside it
     * from the junction on (see {@code StemEditRenderer.Result.isFusion}), so by the time this
     * shape's ramp starts, the transition is <em>already carried</em> by the one source the
     * incoming deck is playing: the live decks no longer have to travel anywhere, they only have
     * to hand over once, at the top. That instant is a bar line — which is why the controller
     * starts this ramp on the outgoing deck's own position rather than on what is left of its
     * file: a hand-over anywhere else would put A's live deck against a file that is not at the
     * same instant, and that is a phase step, not a late blend.
     *
     * <p><b>⚠️ The outgoing track is never force-stopped, and that is the requirement this length
     * answers.</b> The user's own words, after listening to a rendering of the shorter cut:
     * 「你似乎给前一首歌强制停止了，不要这么干，让它放完并不要让它戛然而止，可以加淡出，
     * 但不要抢整体效果」 — <em>you seem to have force-stopped the previous song; do not do that,
     * let it play out and do not let it end abruptly; a fade-out is allowed, but do not let it
     * dominate the whole effect.</em> Both halves of that are properties of this constant and of
     * nothing else: the outgoing deck is <em>released</em> wherever the ramp ends (see
     * {@code AndroidAudioBackend.logOutgoingRelease}), so the only way to keep it from being
     * "stopped" is for its level to have reached zero on its own, musically, well before that
     * instant — and the only way for the fade not to "dominate" is for it to be a small share of
     * the window rather than the window itself.
     *
     * <p><b>Why it is about a bar — {@link #JUNCTION_XFADE_MS} — and no longer 300 ms.</b> The
     * first cut of this shape was an 80 ms equal-power splice (the same 80 ms the fusion's file
     * uses for its bar-line element swaps), on the reasoning that the hand-over should read as a
     * cut; a rendered prototype was listened to and reported as a <b>卡顿</b> exactly at the
     * junction, where the render measured a <b>−2.8…−4.1 dB</b> step and a change of timbre (the
     * live master giving way to the same music rebuilt from separated stems). Three hundred
     * milliseconds turned that step into a slide and was heard as a fade-in instead — but it still
     * ends A on the spot: 300 ms of a 15 s blend is not enough for a phrase to finish. So the
     * window is now one <em>bar</em> of the incoming track at the ramp's own scale. The ramp
     * carries no grid (it is a level curve, not a timeline), which is why this is a constant in the
     * 1.5–2.5 s range rather than a computed bar: 2000 ms covers this library's ordinary tempos
     * (75–160 BPM is a 1.5–3.2 s bar) closely enough for a crossfade whose shape is the thing
     * being heard, and it leaves 13% of a 15 s blend as the hand-over with the remaining 87% at
     * the incoming deck's own level.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the file is continuous with the live deck across the whole window.</b> The window
     * is this long because it <em>can</em> be: the renderer holds the outgoing track's carried
     * rows at unity through it and only lets them recede afterwards ({@code StemFusion}'s own
     * table), so for these two seconds the incoming deck is playing the outgoing track's own
     * material — not a bed, not a shadow of it — and the two decks are carrying the same music.
     * That is what makes the fade a change of source rather than a change of song: at the end of
     * it the listener has lost nothing, because everything the live deck was still going to play
     * is in the file from that same bar line on (the file's copy is cut at exactly this
     * instant — see the controller's position-based trigger).
     *
     * <p><b>Why LINEAR and not EQUAL_POWER — the load-bearing part.</b> The junction is built so
     * the incoming deck starts playing exactly on the outgoing's own bar line, and the file's
     * first bar carries <em>the same material</em> the outgoing deck is playing at that instant
     * (A's own drums, bass and a quiet A melodic over B's bed). The two decks are therefore
     * <em>correlated</em> signals, not independent ones, and the usual reason to prefer equal power
     * — two <em>uncorrelated</em> tracks summed at half gain lose 3 dB of power — does not apply
     * here. It inverts: for correlated (here, literally the same) material the gains sum
     * <em>amplitudes</em>, so an equal-power changeover puts its middle at cos 45° + sin 45° =
     * 1.414 of one deck's level, i.e. <b>+3 dB</b> — a swell in the middle of the hand-over,
     * exactly the 音量跳 the equal-power pair exists to avoid between independent tracks and
     * <em>creates</em> between correlated ones. Equal gain ({@code 1−u} and {@code u}) sums
     * correlated material to one deck's level at every instant, so the music stays flat through
     * the fade — which is the entire point of a hand-over between two copies of the same bar, and
     * the property the harness measures as {@code outGain + inGain = 1} to a float ulp.
     *
     * <p><b>The two gains, exactly.</b> {@code outGain} = 1 at {@code t = 0}, falling linearly to
     * 0 at {@link #JUNCTION_XFADE_MS} into the ramp, then <em>exactly</em> 0 to the end;
     * {@code inGain} = 0 at {@code t = 0}, rising linearly to 1 at the same instant, then exactly
     * 1 to the end. The outgoing deck is consequently <b>not</b> silent for the whole blend — it
     * is audible for the ramp's first 2000 ms by construction, which is the point — but the
     * release assertion is unaffected, because what it needs is not "silent all blend" but "at
     * exactly zero and holding well before anything may release it": this curve reaches exactly
     * zero a bar in and stays there, so {@link #outSilentTail(long)} is {@code rampMs − 2000}
     * (13000 ms of a 15 s ramp, 28000 ms of a 30 s one, 50% of a 4 s one) and
     * {@code AndroidAudioBackend} logs that held stretch on its release line.
     *
     * <p><b>Shorter ramps.</b> The window is a duration, not a share, so a ramp no longer than it
     * gets the whole window as its fade — {@code share = min(1, 2000/rampMs)} — and never runs past
     * the end ({@link #outGain(float, long)}). Realistic fusion ramps are 4–30 s long (the
     * controller's ramp is {@code min(blendMs, remaining − 250)}), where 2000 ms is 7–50% of the
     * window.
     *
     * <p>Not selectable as a 淡化曲线: it is only ever handed to the backend by the controller,
     * for a boundary whose edit is a fusion. Applied to an ordinary boundary — where the incoming
     * deck plays material of its own, uncorrelated with the outgoing's — it would fade the
     * outgoing deck out inside the first 2000 ms and leave the incoming one alone for the rest of

     * dominate. A 300 ms hand-over satisfied neither half: 300 ms is not enough for a phrase to

     * therefore a bar's worth of music rather than a splice's worth of milliseconds. The ramp

     * in the 1.5–2.5 s range covering this library's ordinary tempos — 75–160 BPM is a 1.5–3.2 s
     * bar — with the file holding the outgoing track's own material at unity across the whole of
     * it (see {@link #FUSION}'s doc: the two decks are carrying the same music here, which is why
     * the fade is a change of source and not a change of song).

     * <p>A duration rather than a share of the window, deliberately — and that is exactly why the
     * fusion needs {@link #outGain(float, long)}: 2000 ms is 13% of a 15 s blend and more than a
     * whole 1.5 s one, so a share that meant "a musical fade" at one blend length would mean "the
     * entire blend" at another. Every caller that applies the curve or reports a number for it
     * has the ramp's real length in hand, so the length is passed rather than guessed.
     *
     * <p>The history, because each step was a listening report and the next reader should be able
     * to tell which one a build is: 80 ms (an equal-power splice, the same 80 ms the fusion's file
     * uses for its bar-line element swaps) was heard as a 卡顿 exactly at the junction, where the
     * render measured a −2.8…−4.1 dB step and a change of timbre; 300 ms (the same linear shape,
     * heard as 「新歌的进入请用淡入效果」 — a fade-in for the new song, which was the request at
     * the time) fixed the step but still ended the outgoing song on the spot, which is the report
     * this number answers. See {@link #FUSION}'s doc for why the fade is <em>linear</em> as well:
     * the two decks carry the same material across it and are therefore correlated, and an
     * equal-power fade would sum them to +3 dB in the middle.
