/**
 * A track's beat grid, measured from its own audio by a {@link BeatProfiler}: how
 * fast it moves ({@code bpm} / {@code periodMs}), where its first beat sits in the
 * file ({@code firstBeatMs}), and how much that measurement can be trusted
 * ({@code confidence} — whether the analysed window agrees with itself; the older
 * peak-prominence reading travels along as {@code prominence} and is logged next to
 * it, see {@link #MIN_CONFIDENCE}).
 *
 * <p>This is what lets two tracks' musical grids meet instead of just overlapping
 * in time (see {@code PlayerController}'s overlap alignment): the incoming track
 * starts on one of its own beats, and the outgoing track's ramp starts on one of
 * its own, so the two grids are lined up at the moment they are mixed rather than
 * wherever the file boundaries happened to fall.
 *
 * <p>The grid is a single <em>period</em> plus a <em>phase</em>: real music has
 * bars, sections and tempo changes, none of which this describes. That is
 * deliberate — nothing on this platform measures structure, and a constant period
 * is enough to answer the only two questions the overlap asks ("where is the
 * nearest beat at or after time T" / "is the grid trustworthy"), while a wrong
 * answer stays bounded by {@link #confidence} and by the caller's shift cap.
 *
 * <p>Immutable, and cached per track (see {@code DiskCache}'s beat sub-cache)
 * because the measurement costs a decode while the answer never changes for an
 * unchanged file.

     * The lowest confidence the alignment is allowed to trust. Below this the
     * measurement is reported and logged but never acted on: an autocorrelation
     * peak this weak is what ambient, classical and speech produce, and a wrong
     * BPM acted on is worse than no BPM at all (the whole point of a gate is that
     * the bad case — no beat to find — must not become a bad transition).
     *
     * <p>What the number is compared against is {@link #confidence()}, which is
     * <em>not</em> a peak's prominence any more: it is how much the analysed window
     * agrees with itself when it is cut into segments and each is asked for its own
     * period and phase (see {@code BeatAnalysis#windowAgreement}). The prominence
     * reading is still measured, still travels with the grid ({@link #prominence()})
     * and is still in every log line next to this one, but it is the binding
     * constraint this metric replaced: on a real library it refused roughly half of
     * it — 0.12-0.34 for tracks whose grids are audibly steady — because densely
     * produced music has onsets at every subdivision and a perfectly steady grid's
     * peak therefore stands above very little.
     *
     * <p>Calibrated by measurement rather than taste: a click track at any tempo in
     * range scores a prominence of 0.9-1.0, a 4/4 pattern with different sounds on
     * different beats 0.35-0.7, and material with no beat — speech over a pad, an
     * ambient drone — stays under 0.25; the agreement reading separates the same
     * material with a much wider gap, because a steady grid agrees with itself
     * (measured at 0.6-1.0) while material whose "tempo" is an artefact of one
     * window does not (measured at 0-0.2). It is deliberately the *lower* edge of the
     * useful range: the cost of refusing a real grid is that a transition is not
     * aligned (today's behaviour), while the cost of trusting a wrong one is two
     * songs that do not line up while believing they do.
