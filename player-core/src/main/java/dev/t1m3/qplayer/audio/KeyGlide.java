/**
 * The user's key blend: the modulation section of a blend, where the mix's tonality travels
 * from the outgoing track's key into the incoming track's own — audibly, in a few steps on
 * the grid, on <em>both</em> decks at once.
 *
 * <p><b>What it replaces.</b> Until round 14 the incoming track was transposed into the
 * outgoing track's key for the whole blend and then <em>snapped</em> back to its own pitch
 * at one instant before its vocals returned ({@code AndroidAudioBackend}'s one write —
 * round 13's fix for the per-tick glide that produced a hiccup). A snap is the right shape
 * for a correction and the wrong shape for a transition: the listener hears a key change
 * land as an edit rather than as a move. This class turns that one step into a short ladder
 * of steps spread over the blend's own vocals-out window, so the ear hears the key travel.
 *
 * <p><b>Why both decks move, and not just the incoming one.</b> If the two decks are to be
 * heard in the same key at every instant — which is the whole reason the incoming track was
 * transposed in the first place — then their two shifts are not independent. Writing
 * {@code d} for the semitones that put the incoming track (K<sub>b</sub>) in the outgoing
 * track's key (K<sub>a</sub> = K<sub>b</sub> + d), the outgoing deck's shift {@code a(t)}
 * and the incoming deck's {@code b(t)} are in unison exactly when
 * {@code b(t) − a(t) = d}. At the blend's start the pair is {@code a = 0, b = d} (the
 * outgoing track in its own key, the incoming one pulled into it). The incoming track's
 * vocals must arrive in its OWN key — that is the rule this codebase has held since round 12
 * — so the end of the modulation is {@code b = 0}, and then the same equation forces
 * {@code a = −d}: the outgoing deck is a whole key away from where it started. So
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>both decks move</b> (each by exactly {@code |d|} semitones, in the same
 *   direction, keeping {@code b − a = d} at all times): the <em>tonality of the mix</em>
 *   travels from K<sub>a</sub> to K<sub>b</sub> while the two tracks never fight — this is
 *   the classical "riser into the new key";</li>
 *   <li><b>or neither does</b> ({@code a ≡ 0} forces {@code b ≡ d}: no modulation at all,
 *   which is exactly the behaviour this class replaces);</li>
 *   <li>and the third possibility — the incoming deck alone gliding to its own key while
 *   the outgoing stays put — is <b>not</b> a third shape but the worst of both: the pair is
 *   in unison only at the start and ends a whole key apart, <em>while both are still
 *   audible</em>, i.e. the second half of the blend is deliberately detuned. Today's snap
 *   at least keeps the two in unison for the whole overlap.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That is why {@code semitones != 0} plus a section long enough to glide means both
 * decks are written, and why the log names both curves. The cost is stated rather than
 * hidden: the outgoing deck's own material is transposed too — a sung note in the outgoing
 * tail is heard a semitone or two away from where it was recorded. It is bounded
 * ({@link IncomingMix#MAX_SEMITONES} semitones over many seconds, not an effect) and it is
 * front-loaded against the outgoing track's own gain: the deck is at its quietest when its
 * shift is largest (the ladder is monotone and the DJ curve is already taking that deck
 * down), which is why every step's log line carries the audible deck's gain as well.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the steps land.</b> On the incoming track's own beat grid, a whole number of
 * beats apart, with the last one <em>at or before</em> the instant the pitch rule's deadline
 * falls on ({@code MixNaturaliser.VOCAL_PITCH_MARGIN_MS} before that track's vocals) — the
 * same "the last beat at or before the deadline" round 13 used for its single step, and for
 * the same reason: a beat is where the material the deck is playing (its backing, since the
 * DJ edit holds its vocals out) has its attack, so a parameter change is at its most hidden.
 * The spacing is rounded up to whole bars when the section has room for it, because a
 * modulation that moves every bar reads as a phrase rather than as a rattle. The number of
 * steps is capped ({@link #MAX_STEPS}) so the ladder is a handful of writes rather than a
 * tick loop: {@code MAX_STEPS} writes per deck over a section of seconds, every one of them
 * on an instant the music already emphasises.
 *
 * <p>Immutable, platform-free and tiny: built once per boundary, from profiles the
 * controller already has, and handed to the backend inside the {@link IncomingMix} the
 * incoming player is prepared with.
