 *
 * <p>This is what lets a transition do more than align the beats: two tracks in
 * clashing keys mixed together is the one thing harmonic mixing exists to avoid,
 * and a key estimate plus a pitch-class profile is enough to answer the two
 * questions that matter — "how far apart are these two harmonically" and "would
 * moving one of them by a semitone or two make it better".
 *
 * <p>The key <em>name</em> is the part to be careful with. It is a single
 * answer to a question real music mostly does not have one answer for (a loop of
 * Am-F-C-G is as much C major as A minor), so it is reported and logged but
 * never acted on alone: the shift is chosen from the profile distance below,
 * with the name only able to confirm or veto a candidate (see
 * {@link #camelotCompatible}). The profile is the measurement; the name is a
 * summary of it.
 *
 * <p>Immutable, and cached per track with the beat grid it was measured beside
 * (see {@link BeatProfile}'s disk form), because both come out of the same
 * decode.

     *  {@link #trustworthy()} applies {@link #MIN_TRIAD} as well.
     *
     *  <p>The number is unchanged from the calibration that produced it; what

     *  the winner could <em>not</em> be mixed with ({@link KeyAnalysis}), scaled so
     *  that this reads directly as a correlation margin. Measured on 36 cached
     *  windows of the app's own library: 0.012-1.54, median 0.44, and 24 of the 36
     *  clear 0.25 — where the previous measure passed 8 of the same 36 and named 16
     *  of them A minor. Material with no key stays below: white noise 0.09, a bare
     *  sine 0.00, a pitchless drum loop 0.19. The one class of material the margin
     *  alone does not refuse is noise with a fixed spectral envelope (0.47), which
     *  is what {@link #MIN_TRIAD} is for.
     *
     *  <p>It is deliberately the *lower* edge — of what this measure can separate,
     *  not of the whole spread — for the same reason {@link #MIN_CONFIDENCE} is:
     *  the cost of refusing a real key is that a pair is not transposed (today's
     *  behaviour), while the cost of trusting a wrong one is a track that sounds
     *  out of tune. The remaining protection against a wrong-but-confident key is
     *  in the shift decision itself ({@code MixMatch}: the improvement has to be
     *  real, and the whole-key relationship has to hold). */

     * much more.
     *
     * <p>This is the second, independent condition {@link #trustworthy()} applies,
     * and it is here because the first one alone does not separate real music from
     * material with no key at all. Measured on the app's own 36-track cache: the
     * margin the first condition reads is 0.19-1.5 across real tracks but one
     * constructed negative — noise with a fixed spectral envelope, which is what
     * speech and applause look like to a pitch-class profile — scored 0.47, above
     * much of the library. Its profile was flat: 0.270 on the winner's triad
     * against a uniform 0.25, where the real tracks ran 0.26-0.41. Neither number
     * separates on its own; together they do, and both negatives (that noise, and
     * a pitchless drum loop at 0.192/0.272) fall outside the gate while 21 of the
     * 36 real tracks stay inside it.
     *
     * <p>The threshold is the recorded gap's edge rather than its middle, for the
     * same asymmetric reason as {@link #MIN_STRENGTH}: refusing a real key costs a
     * pair its transposition (today's behaviour), while trusting a wrong one
