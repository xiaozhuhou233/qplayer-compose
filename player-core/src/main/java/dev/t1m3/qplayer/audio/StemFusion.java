/**
 * The fusion: both tracks' backgrounds combined into ONE passage, three bars long, written into
 * the incoming track's own file — round 18's replacement for the fade a two-deck blend is.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is for.</b> A blend of two records reads as a fade in the middle whatever the
 * gain curves do, because the outgoing track's <em>rhythm</em> leaves with it (the low end is
 * handed over part way through, and its body ramps away over the next seconds). The fusion stops
 * fading altogether: the outgoing track's own bars continue inside the incoming's file, and each
 * of its elements is removed by an <b>80 ms splice on a bar line</b> — never by a level ramp over
 * a whole track — while the incoming's own elements arrive on the same lines, one bar apart.
 * Nothing audible about the transition therefore sits on a fade curve.
 *
 * <pre>
 * | file window        | A drums | A bass | A other | B drums | B bass | B other |
 * | [entry, swap)      | unity   | unity  | -12 dB  | 0       | 0      | silence -> unity |
 * | [swap, bass)       | 0       | unity  | -12 dB  | unity   | 0      | unity           |
 * | [bass, fusionEnd)  | 0       | 0      | 0       | unity   | unity  | unity           |
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Every `unity`/`0` pair above is one {@link #CUT_MS} equal-power splice on the bar line, and
 * each one is counted and reported ({@link Report#splices}). <b>The one exception is the
 * incoming's own bed ({@code other}), which fades in over {@link #BED_FADE_BARS} bar — one whole
 * bar of its own grid, equal-power, from {@code entry} to unity.</b> The user asked for exactly
 * that after hearing the first prototype (「新歌的进入请用淡入效果」), and it is also what keeps the
 * level the listener is at continuous while the outgoing track's voice leaves: a bed arriving over
 * the same bar the voice departs is what masks it. The incoming's drums and low end still swap
 * <em>by cut</em> on their own lines — that is the hand-over's signature, and a faded drum swap
 * would smear the pulse. Outside the window the file is exactly what it is without a fusion: the
 * incoming's backing at unity under its own vocal gate. The outgoing's <b>vocal row is never
 * carried</b> — the whole point of the window is that neither track sings over the other.
 *
 * <p><b>The second half of the junction's contract is the peak.</b> The outgoing's own master
 * already peaks at about full scale, so any added bed is over it — a static divisor over the head
 * is not acceptable (measured on real material: −4.55 dB over the whole head, which the listener
 * heard as a 卡顿 at the junction). The head therefore carries a peak limiter ({@link
 * DjEdit.Limiter}: 1 ms attack, 150 ms release, no makeup gain), and the render measures its own
 * <b>step</b>: the fusion's first {@link #STEP_WINDOW_MS} RMS against the outgoing master's last
 * {@link #STEP_WINDOW_MS}, which has to be within {@link #JUNCTION_STEP_MAX_DB}. A fusion that
 * cannot sit at the outgoing's own level is refused rather than played as a drop.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the material comes from.</b> The outgoing deck is cut on a bar line of its own grid
 * ({@code junctionMs}), so the passage the file carries is the music that <em>would have played
 * next</em> — decoded when the outgoing deck dies and carried forward inside the incoming's file,
 * resampled by {@code speed} so that playback at {@code speed} returns it to the outgoing track's
 * own tempo and pitch (the same bargain {@link StemBridge} makes for its two bars of bass).
 *
 * <p>Pure arithmetic on separated stems: no platform, no files, no model — so what a render will
 * do is a unit test, and the acceptance numbers ({@link #measure}) are the same arithmetic the
 * render reports. This is the round-17 {@link StemBridge} pattern applied to the whole backing
 * rather than to the bass alone; it reuses that class's measurement primitives
 * ({@link StemBridge#levelDb}, {@link StemBridge#frameLevelsDb}, {@link StemBridge#median},
 * {@link StemBridge#alignmentAtZeroLag}) so "quiet", "present" and "the voice" mean the same
 * thing in both places.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the spliced gesture is not {@link StemGesture}'s.</b> {@code StemGesture} carries the
 * ported Folia grammar — a <em>takeover</em> scored by listening rounds, whose cut is
 * {@link StemGesture#CUT_SEC} = 500 ms and whose shapes are the harness's own. The fusion's
 * gesture is a different thing (three fixed bars, 80 ms splices, per-row silence) and its shape is
 * fixed by the spec, so it is written here; what is reused is {@link StemGesture#Stem} (the model's
 * row order), {@link StemGesture#barLines} (via the caller's own bar-line computation) and
 * {@link StemGesture#CUT_SEC}'s sibling idea of an equal-power splice.

     * Measure one rendered fusion.
     *
     * <p>The clauses, and why each of them is the one that matters here:
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>The carried rows are there and are the material they claim.</b> Each row, inside
     *       the part of the window where the table has it on, must measure within {@link
     *       #CARRY_TOLERANCE_DB} of its own source level under the table's gain — no more than
     *       3 dB below it (a carry that lost its groove) and no more than 3 dB above the row's
     *       own source (a carry summed twice, or the wrong row placed). The carried low end is
     *       additionally asked about the {@link #CARRY_END_WINDOW_MS} <em>right before the gesture
     *       takes over</em>: a take that is shorter than the gesture needs goes silent exactly
     *       there (that was round 18's defect — A's bed dying on a hard cut the table never
     *       names), and a clause measured over the whole of [entry, bassMs) would average it
     *       away. Round 6 added the matching clause for the fade itself, where the same defect
     *       now hides: {@link #carriedBassFadeDb} against the source under the table's own
     *       equal-power fade ({@link #FADE_RMS_DB}, tolerance {@link
     *       #CARRY_FADE_TOLERANCE_DB}).</li>
     *   <li><b>The outgoing's vocal content did not come along.</b> Each carried row is compared
     *       with the outgoing's separated vocal stem at zero lag: a row that is that voice is
     *       fatal for the drums and the bass and <em>drops the melodic carry</em> for {@code
     *       other} — the design's stated degradation, which keeps the groove and loses the
     *       pad.</li>
     *   <li><b>The incoming's drums are silent before their swap and present after</b> (and the
     *       same for its low end a bar later) — the table's own claim, measured rather than
     *       asserted.</li>
     *   <li><b>The junction sits at the outgoing's own level.</b> The rendered head's first {@link
     *       #STEP_WINDOW_MS} against the outgoing master's last {@link #STEP_WINDOW_MS}, within
     *       {@link #JUNCTION_STEP_MAX_DB}. This is the clause the round-18 prototype's junction
     *       failed on real material (the static divisor's −4.10 dB, which the listener heard as a
     *       卡顿), and the reason the head carries a limiter and the bed arrives over a bar.</li>
     *   <li><b>No long clipping.</b> The sum of two backings can exceed full scale; a rare
     *       clamped peak is a splice landing on one, but a run or a share past the limits means
     *       the passage is mixed too loud to be the master.</li>
     *   <li><b>The pulse holds.</b> Attacks on the slower grid, judged on the passage's own
     *       rhythm rows (both backings' drums and bass, as the table places them) rather than on
     *       the whole mix: the melodic beds are deliberately present the whole time and would
     *       hide a hole in the groove. This is the clause that catches an outgoing ending with no
     *       rhythm in it — a fade, a break, a spoken outro — which is the same hazard {@link
     *       StemBridge#measure} exists for.</li>
