/**
 * The default {@link TransitionChooser}: a fixed, explainable rule set over
 * metadata, no network and no randomness, so the same two tracks always get the
 * same transition and every choice can be argued for in one sentence.
 *
 * <p>The rules are ordered from "cannot be performed" to "what the pair itself
 * suggests", and every one of them may only return a kind the boundary can
 * actually perform — an answer that would need a second player for a BILI link
 * or a local file is downgraded here, not discovered later.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <b>The default answer is an overlap.</b> Only four things are allowed to
 * refuse one, and all four are physical (a side that cannot go on a second player,
 * a boundary that has already arrived, a length nobody knows, and — for the shape
 * of the overlap, not for whether there is one — a track that is too short for it).
 * Nothing about tempo, key or a beat grid can refuse anything here: those only
 * decide whether the overlap can additionally be <em>aligned</em>, which is the
 * controller's business after this answer is given. An earlier round answered
 * {@link TransitionKind#SILENCE_TRIM} (a 250 ms seam) for every pair of long
 * tracks, which is the least audible transition there is — and because that is the
 * answer an ordinary library of long tracks got for every boundary, the whole
 * feature was heard as "nothing happened".
 *
 * <p>{@link TransitionKind#SILENCE_TRIM} is now chosen only on evidence: when the
 * outgoing track has actually been <em>measured</em> to trail more than
 * {@link #TRIM_TAIL_MIN_MS} of silence. There is nothing to overlap there — an
 * eight-second ramp would spend most of itself fading music into silence — so butting
 * the two contents together is demonstrably better, and the measurement that says so
 * is already in hand. Without that measurement the answer is the plain overlap.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <b>Round 19: one rule is not about the pair at all — the incoming track's own
 * rendered edit.</b> When that edit is a <em>fusion</em>
 * ({@link TransitionContext#incomingEditIsFusion()}), the transition is already inside
 * the file the incoming deck will play, so the answer is {@link TransitionKind#CROSSFADE}
 * whatever the pair's numbers say — that is the rule at the top of {@link #choose}, and it
 * is the one case where a measured clash does <em>not</em> buy a sequential fade: there is
 * no second tempo or key to clash with, because the file carries both tracks' material
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>To be replaced by an AI implementation later through
 * {@code PlayerController.setTransitionChooser(...)}; this class stays as the
 * fallback and as the definition of "sensible defaults" that implementation has
 * to beat.
