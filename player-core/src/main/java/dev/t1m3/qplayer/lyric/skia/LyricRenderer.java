 * Apple Music-style lyric column. Lines are left-anchored at {@code leftX}
 * and wrap into a column of width {@code columnWidth}. The active line is
 * vertically centered in the visible area; surrounding lines flow above/
 * below in a dimmer style. Each visual row is shaped once with HarfBuzz and
 * cached as a TextBlob; a runtime shader applies independently timed syllable
 * lift without splitting that shaped row back into draw calls.
 *
 * <p>The layout/shaping pass is cached: each line is broken at syllable
 * boundaries when its width exceeds the column, and every wrapped sub-row
 * counts toward the line's total height. Scroll is driven by cumulative
 * {@code lineTops}, not a fixed per-line spacing, so wrapped lines push later
 * lines down without overlapping while playback frames reuse native blobs.
