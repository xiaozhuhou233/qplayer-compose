 * model happily returns twenty tracks of one language and then twenty of the other, or all of one.
 * The prompt asks for a mix, but a prompt is not a guarantee, so the ordering is also decided
 * <em>here</em>, on the resolved rows, where it can be tested.
 *
 * <p>Two things make this work with no metadata at all: the language of a row is read off its own
 * text ({@link #isChinese} — the library carries no language field anywhere, see {@code Track}), and
 * the interleave is <em>proportional</em> rather than strictly alternating, because a strict
 * alternation cannot express "eight Chinese and two English" without clumping the tail.
 *
 * <p>Rows are never re-ordered inside their own language: the AI's own ranking within a language is
 * the ranking the user asked for, and this class only decides which language comes next.
