/**
 * The single QML-facing object. Registered as a context global
 * ({@code view.context("player", controller)}); QML binds to its public
 * {@link Property} fields (reactive — reading registers a dependency, the
 * controller's {@code set} re-evaluates the binding) and invokes its public
 * methods from event handlers.
 *
 * <h3>Playback queue</h3>
 * Local files and netease lists both feed one {@link #queue} of {@link Track}s.
 * Netease tracks carry their id + metadata but resolve their CDN url lazily on
 * first play (so a whole playlist can be queued without fetching every url).
 * {@code next}/{@code prev} walk the queue; auto-advance wires
 * {@code backend.onComplete -> next}.
 *
 * <h3>Threading</h3>
 * The qml4j renderer is single-threaded, so every {@code Property.set} must run
 * on the render thread. QML-invoked methods run there and mutate directly. Work
 * that must run off it — audio completion, blocking netease HTTP — posts its
 * result via {@link #post(Runnable)}; the host drains the queue once per frame
 * in {@link #pump()}.

     * meet or fight, and until they meet, a 15 s overlap really is just two songs
     * playing at once (which is why a long overlap could sound worse than a 4 s
     * seam).
     *
     * <p>⚠️ <b>Nothing here can refuse the overlap.</b> The kind, its length and the
     * fact that there is a blend at all were decided by the chooser, and the only
     * things that can take that away are physical (see {@code decideTransition}).
     * What this method can decide is whether the blend is additionally <em>aligned</em>
     * — an overlap whose grids cannot be established runs exactly as it would have
     * before any of this existed, and the log says which piece was missing.
     *
     * <p>Two gates, both about the alignment only:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>a beat profiler must exist on this host and 节拍对齐 must be on;</li>
     *   <li>the OUTGOING track's grid must exist and be trustworthy. Every overlap
     *       snaps to that grid, so a track with no beat (ambient, classical, speech —
     *       the estimator refuses those, or answers below
     *       {@link BeatProfile#MIN_CONFIDENCE}) has nothing to snap to.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The incoming track's grid is a second, separate gate — it is needed to place the
     * incoming's own entry — and the two grids being <em>compatible</em> is a third,
     * needed only for the overlap length to stay on A's grid all the way through.
     * None of them is about key, and none is about a tempo <em>match</em> in the sense
     * of equal tempos: they are asked about the grid the listener will hear, so a pair
     * the naturaliser pulled onto A's grid passes the compatibility gate by
     * construction, and a pair it could not (or would not) touch is asked exactly what
     * it was asked before. Either way the overlap happens, at the length the plan
     * named, and the line says what was and was not done.
     *
     * <p>⚠️ The low-end hand-over is deliberately NOT behind those last two gates. It
     * needs one musical instant — a beat of the outgoing track, which is running at its
     * own tempo — and no second grid at all, so a pair whose grids slide apart (which
     * is most pairs, now that the ordinary overlap is fifteen seconds: the compatibility
     * gate tolerates about 1.6% of tempo difference over 15 s against 6% over 4 s) still
     * gets its bass swapped, with the log saying the overlap itself is unaligned. The

     *  this app can measure). With round 17's shape, {@code outGain} and {@code inGain} cross
     *  at t=0.14 (0.60 against 0.60, a gap of 0.1 dB) — the outgoing track is on its way down

     *  the blend's lowest slice falls <b>−1.9 dB</b> below its loudest with no hand-over at

     *  track is a bed rather than a full-level track: from the bed until the hand-over the only
     *  low end in the mix is a deck that has been taken 10 dB down, and then a second deck's
     *  bottom arrives from nowhere.
     *
     *  <p>What it costs is the thing round 12 was answering: the outgoing track's kick is gone
     *  2.3 s into a 15 s blend instead of 9 s. That is affordable <em>because of the same
     *  shape change</em> — the outgoing track is 10 dB down by 4.5 s and gone by 12.3 s, so its

     * uncached next track routinely arrives too late and the boundary hard-cuts — the
     * transition machinery was left choosing between a late fade and no fade at all.
     *
     * <p>This is the existing audio disk cache, not a second downloader: the same
     * {@code DiskCache.cacheAudio} the ordinary play path fills, keyed the same way
     * (by netease id), so the ordinary play path is unchanged and a pre-cached track
     * is simply one that path already had ("play netease (audio cache)"). The resolved
     * url is deliberately NOT written back onto the Track: a url parked in
     * {@code streamUrl} would send the next ordinary play down the cached-url fast
     * path, which skips the metadata enrichment that path leaves out.
     *
     * <p>Bounded on every other side too:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>only with the transition feature on, and only for a track that could be
     *       transitioned into at all — a netease track ({@code DiskCache}'s audio
     *       sub-cache is keyed by netease id, so a custom-API source has nothing to
     *       cache under), never a trial clip and never BILI/LOCAL;</li>
     *   <li>nothing is fetched when the file is already there;</li>
     *   <li>nothing is fetched when the shared cache is already at its size budget:
     *       the file would evict something the moment it landed (LRU, oldest first)
     *       and buy a download nobody keeps. The existing eviction is the bound — the
     *       user accepts that a pre-cache may be evicted later — this only refuses to
     *       churn;</li>
     *   <li>one at a time, and cancelled when the queue moves on: the generation is
     *       bumped by every track start, and a task that is no longer the current next
     *       track returns before it resolves or downloads anything. A download already
     *       in flight is not interruptible through this cache (it is a plain stream
     *       copy); it finishes, and the file it leaves is a valid cache entry for a
     *       track the listener may still reach.</li>
