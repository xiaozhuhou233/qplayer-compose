/**
 * The single QML-facing object. Registered as a context global
 * ({@code view.context("player", controller)}); QML binds to its public
 * {@link Property} fields (reactive — reading registers a dependency, the
 * controller's {@code set} re-evaluates the binding) and invokes its public
 * methods from event handlers.
 *
 * <h3>Playback queue</h3>
 * Local files and netease lists both feed one {@link #queue} of {@link Track}s.
 * Netease tracks carry their id + metadata but resolve their CDN url lazily on
 * first play (so a whole playlist can be queued without fetching every url).
 * {@code next}/{@code prev} walk the queue; auto-advance wires
 * {@code backend.onComplete -> next}.
 *
 * <h3>Threading</h3>
 * The qml4j renderer is single-threaded, so every {@code Property.set} must run
 * on the render thread. QML-invoked methods run there and mutate directly. Work
 * that must run off it — audio completion, blocking netease HTTP — posts its
 * result via {@link #post(Runnable)}; the host drains the queue once per frame
 * in {@link #pump()}.
