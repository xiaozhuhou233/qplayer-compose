/**
 * The key estimator against material whose answer is known.

 * <p>This is the only part of the mix that has ground truth: a C major triad IS
 * C major, and a chroma-distance threshold can be calibrated against material
 * that was written in two known keys. The synthesised signals are additive tones
 * with a full harmonic series (a sawtooth-like spectrum, which is what real
 * instruments and voices actually have — and what makes key finding hard, because
 * a note's third and fifth harmonics put energy on the fifth and the major third
 * as well as on its own pitch class).
 *
 * <p>What is asserted is the accuracy the gate needs, not perfection: the caller
 * only ever acts on an estimate above {@link KeyProfile#MIN_STRENGTH}, and the
 * measured numbers are printed so the thresholds can be argued from them rather
 * than from taste.
