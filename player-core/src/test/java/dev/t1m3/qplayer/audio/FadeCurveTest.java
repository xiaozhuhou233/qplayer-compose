/**
 * The shapes an overlap's gains can follow, and the properties of them that can be
 * measured rather than argued about: how much of the overlap has <em>both</em> tracks
 * audible at once, how far the outgoing track is taken down, and where it leaves.
 *
 * <p>Three rounds of listening reports are encoded here, and they point in different
 * directions on purpose:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>rounds 10–12 — "it still sounds like a fade-in/fade-out rather than a mix": the
 *       symmetric pair keeps the two gains comparable only near the middle (41% of the
 *       window), so the staged shape was built to hold both tracks up;</li>
 *   <li>round 16 — 「上一首歌戛然而止」 (the previous song cut off): holding the outgoing
 *       track at its own level until three quarters and then dropping it is heard as a
 *       cliff, so the exit got a shape of its own;</li>
 *   <li>round 17 — 「让…前一首歌部分淡一点，要不抢了」 and 「过渡部分不要保留非常高亢人声」
 *       (make the previous song quieter so it stops stealing the show; do not keep loud
 *       vocals inside the blend): the outgoing track's vocals cannot be removed from its
 *       stream, so the shape takes the whole track down to a −10 dB bed early and leaves
 *       it earlier. The both-audible share falls from 68% to 17% and that is the point.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The numbers below are printed by {@code Curve17} in the round-17 harness and by
 * running this class; they are the same arithmetic either way.
