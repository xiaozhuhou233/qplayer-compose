/**
 * ⚠️ Round 6's second pass: the recede WAITS for the row that replaces it.
 *
 * <p>The device run of {@code AGUDO MAGKLCO -> Lose My Mind} is the whole reason this exists. Its
 * plan was right (the units defect is gone) and its only failing clause was the pulse: "10 of 15
 * beats carry an attack, longest gap 2832ms of a 566ms period". The arithmetic of that hole is the
 * incoming's own intro — {@code Lose My Mind}'s first ~3 s of head carry no drums at all (its
 * per-beat peaks run −8 −10 −20 −34 −38 −42 −52 −51 −37 −54 −58 −53 −57 −56 −54 −51 before the kit
 * returns), so once A's drums had faded there was no kit in either backing: the design's hold put
 * A's drums out over [5 260, 7 440) ms of the file, A's last carried attack is at 5 583, the
 * incoming's kit returns at 8 415, and 8 415 − 5 583 = 2 832 ms, the hole the acceptance measured.
 *
 * <p>So the hold is keyed off the incoming's material ({@link StemFusion#rowStartMs} on its own
 * separated head, which the renderer already has), and a pair whose incoming rows never arrive
 * inside the passage it can afford is refused <em>by that name</em> rather than accepted and
 * measured as a pulse hole.
