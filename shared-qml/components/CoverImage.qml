// Rounded album-cover image with a glyph placeholder shown until the cover
// decodes. `source` accepts a local asset path or an http(s) URL — the engine
// Image fetches + decodes remote sources off-thread. Rounding is done by the
// Image's own `radius` (a clipRRect at draw time), NOT a layer.effect mask: the
// mask path allocates an offscreen surface per instance every frame, so a grid
// of covers paid one saveLayer per card per frame while scrolling. clipRRect is
// a cheap per-frame clip with no offscreen allocation.
