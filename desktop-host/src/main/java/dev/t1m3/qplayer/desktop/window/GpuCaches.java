/**
 * Invalidates the QML scene's GPU-backed caches after the {@code DirectContext}
 * they were created against has been destroyed (minimize-to-tray tears the GPU
 * stack down; restore builds a fresh context). The only GPU-bound cache in the
 * qml4j scene tree is {@link Canvas}'s offscreen {@code backing} surface — every
 * other item paints straight to the frame canvas — so a recursive walk that
 * closes + nulls each {@code Canvas.backing} is enough; they lazily rebuild
 * against the new context on the next paint.
 *
 * <p>Runs on the render thread, before the first frame of a respawned thread,
 * while no context is bound to the stale surfaces.
